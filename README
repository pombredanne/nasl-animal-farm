This is a python 3.5 based tool for statically parsing function calls and function definitions out of NASL script.

To start source the setup script into your environment:  . ./setup.sh
Then try the two test programs on a single NASL file:
   ./tests/muriel/tester.py -f <plugin name>
   ./tests/moses/tester.py -f <plugin name>


To run the tests, set up the environment then invoke pytest.
